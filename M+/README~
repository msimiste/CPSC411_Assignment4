NOTE: The m+ compiler handles M programs which do not have arrays or 
      datatypes.


To run the m+ compiler you need to set the following alias

alias M  '/usr/bin/sml @SMLload=/home/411/M+/m+.x86-linux'


The m+ compiler can be called in the following modes:

(i) m+ <filename1> <filename2>

This compiles the m+ program in <filename1> and APPENDS the code to 
<filename2>, if this file does not exist it is created.  So it is 
important to realize that if it exists already you will not get the 
effect you want!

(ii) m+ <filename>

This compiles the m+ program in <filename> and APPENDS the code to 
the output file who name is determined as follows:
    (a) if <filename> = <file>.m+ then the output file is <file>.am
    (b) otherwise the output file is <filename>.am.  


BEWARE: the compiler has minimal error handling: I just threw it 
        together so you could see the sort of output expected.

EXAMPLES: Examples of m+ programs are in the directory m+tests.
          If you develop any interesting examples of m+ programs 
          (to test for interesting errors or to do neat things) 
          please let me know.
